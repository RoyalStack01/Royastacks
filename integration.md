## Config

| Key                               | Value                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Network                           | Mezo Testnet — Chain ID `31611`                        |

## How It Works (High Level)

The server owns the admin wallet. When a user starts a room, the **server** calls `createPool()` on-chain — the user never touches that function. What the frontend handles directly on the contract is **only deposit and withdraw**.

```
User clicks "Start Room"
  → POST /api/rooms/create           (server creates pool on-chain, returns poolId)
  → Show "Fund the Pot" screen
  → User: token.approve() + contract.deposit(poolId, amount)
  → Server detects DepositMade event, registers player
  → POST /api/pools/:poolId/join     (registers player in server state)
  → Wait for 4 more players
  → Game starts automatically at 5 players
```

---

## 1. Auth

Every REST call and the WebSocket connection require a session token.

### Step 1 — Get a nonce

```
POST /api/auth/nonce
Body: { "walletAddress": "0x..." }

Response: { "nonce": "abc123", "message": "Sign this message...\nNonce: abc123" }
```

### Step 2 — Sign and verify

User signs the `message` with their wallet (e.g. via ethers `signMessage`), then:

```
POST /api/auth/verify
Body: { "walletAddress": "0x...", "signature": "0x...", "message": "..." }

Response: { "sessionToken": "...", "walletAddress": "0x...", "expiresIn": 86400 }
```

Use the token on all subsequent calls:

```
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>
```

### Logout

```
POST /api/auth/logout
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>
```

---

## 2. Starting a Room

The frontend calls the server — the server creates the pool on-chain using its own wallet.

```
POST /api/rooms/create
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>

Response: { "poolId": "42" }
```

After getting `poolId`, immediately show the **Fund the Pot** screen (step 3).

---

## 3. Funding the Pot (Deposit)

This is the only time the frontend talks to the contract directly. Two transactions required. Players deposit **Mezo Token** (ERC-20) — not mBTC. mBTC is only needed in the wallet to cover gas on both transactions.

### Step A — Approve the contract to spend the user's Mezo Token

```js
const MEZO_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x7B7c000000000000000000000000000000000001";
const token = new ethers.Contract(MEZO_TOKEN_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, signer);
await token.approve(POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, amount);
```

Minimum ERC-20 ABI needed for approval:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "function",
    "name": "approve",
    "inputs": [
      { "name": "spender", "type": "address" },
      { "name": "amount", "type": "uint256" }
    ],
    "outputs": [{ "name": "", "type": "bool" }],
    "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
  }
]
```

### Step B — Deposit into the pool

```js
const pool = new ethers.Contract(POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, POOL_ABI, signer);
await pool.deposit(poolId, amount);
```

ABI for `deposit`:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "deposit",
  "inputs": [
    { "name": "poolId", "type": "uint256" },
    { "name": "amount", "type": "uint256" }
  ],
  "outputs": [],
  "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
}
```

### Step C — Register with server

After the deposit tx confirms, tell the server:

```
POST /api/pools/:poolId/join
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>
Body: { "amount": <same amount as deposit, as number> }

Response: { "poolId": "42", "playerCount": 1, "isFull": false }
```

---

## 4. Joining an Existing Room

User picks a room from the lobby. Same flow as above (steps 3A → 3B → 3C) but with an existing `poolId`.

### Browse open pools

```
GET /api/pools
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>

Response: [
  {
    "poolId": "42",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "playerCount": 3,
    "isFull": false,
    "totalDeposited": "3000000000000000000",
    "creator": "0x...",
    "cancellationInfo": null
  }
]
```

### Get a single pool

```
GET /api/pools/:poolId
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>

Response: {
  "poolId": "42",
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "playerCount": 3,
  "isFull": false,
  "players": [
    { "address": "0x...", "stack": 1000, "joinedAt": 1715600000000, "status": "active" }
  ],
  "totalDeposited": "3000000000000000000",
  "creator": "0x...",
  "cancellationInfo": null
}
```

---

## 5. Real-time Game (WebSocket)

Connect after auth:

```js
import { io } from "socket.io-client";

const socket = io("http://localhost:3002", {
  auth: { token: sessionToken },
});
```

### Join the room channel

```js
socket.emit('JOIN_POOL', { poolId: '42' });
// Server confirms:
socket.on('POOL_JOINED', ({ poolId, walletAddress }) => { ... });
// Others in room see:
socket.on('PLAYER_JOINED', ({ walletAddress }) => { ... });
```

### Send a game action

```js
socket.emit("PLAYER_ACTION", {
  poolId: "42",
  action: {
    type: "bet", // 'bet' | 'call' | 'raise' | 'fold' | 'check'
    amount: 100, // omit for fold/check/call
  },
});
```

### Game state updates

Every action triggers this for all players in the room:

```js
socket.on("GAME_STATE_UPDATED", (state) => {
  // state.stage          → 'preflop' | 'flop' | 'turn' | 'river' | 'showdown'
  // state.pot            → total chips in pot
  // state.currentPlayer  → walletAddress whose turn it is
  // state.communityCards → ['Ah', 'Kd', '7c'] (grows each street)
  // state.players[]      → see below
  // state.winners        → null until showdown
});
```

Player object inside `state.players`:

```js
{
  walletAddress: '0x...',
  chips: 9500,
  bet: 100,
  folded: false,
  holeCards: ['As', 'Ks']  // only populated for the authenticated player
                             // null for all other players until showdown
}
```

### Other events to handle

| Event            | When                         | Payload             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `ACTION_INVALID` | Your action was rejected     | `{ error: string }` |
| `PLAYER_LEFT`    | Someone disconnected         | `{ walletAddress }` |
| `HAND_SAVED`     | Hand recorded after showdown | `{ handId }`        |

### Leave a room

```js
socket.emit("LEAVE_POOL", { poolId: "42" });
```

---

## 6. Leaving a Room (Before Game Starts)

A player who has already deposited calls `withdrawDeposit()` directly on the contract to take their Mezo Token back out. The server detects the `WithdrawalMade` event and removes them from the room automatically.

### Step 1 — Call withdrawDeposit on-chain

```js
const pool = new ethers.Contract(POOL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS, POOL_ABI, signer);
await pool.withdrawDeposit(poolId);
```

ABI:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "withdrawDeposit",
  "inputs": [{ "name": "poolId", "type": "uint256" }],
  "outputs": [],
  "stateMutability": "nonpayable"
}
```

### Step 2 — Notify server

After the tx confirms, tell the server to update its state:

```
POST /api/pools/:poolId/leave
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>

Response: { "message": "Left pool", "poolId": "42", "playersRemaining": 2 }
```

---

## 7. Pool Cancellation (Server-Triggered)

The server calls `cancelPool()` when the room doesn't reach 5 players within 10 minutes. This is automatic — players do not trigger it.

`cancelPool()` **automatically refunds all remaining depositors** in the same transaction. No action required from players — their Mezo Token is returned immediately when the tx confirms.

Listen for `WithdrawalMade` events per participant to confirm individual refunds landed.

```
GET /api/pools/:poolId/cancellation-info
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>

Response (cancelled): { "cancelled": true, "reason": "timeout", "timestamp": 1715600000000 }
Response (active):    { "cancelled": false }
```

---

## 8. Player Stats

```
GET /api/players/:walletAddress/stats
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>

Response: { "handsPlayed": 12, "handsWon": 4, "totalWinnings": 8000 }
```

```
GET /api/leaderboard?limit=10
Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>
```

---

## 9. Contract Events to Watch (Optional)

If the frontend wants to react to on-chain events without polling the server:

| Event                                         | Trigger                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DepositMade(poolId, participant, amount)`    | Player funded the pot                                                   |
| `PoolCancelled(poolId, creator)`              | Pool was cancelled — refunds are processing                             |
| `WithdrawalMade(poolId, participant, amount)` | One participant's refund confirmed (emitted per player by `cancelPool`) |
| `awardedPot(poolId, participant, amount)`     | Winner paid out                                                         |

Full ABI is in `src/chain/abis/Pool.json`.
